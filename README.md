# Fair and Square Blackjack
Implemented my own Blackjack because I feel like other digital Blackjack out there are rigged when I'm unlucky sometimes and that
irritates me. Only way to ensure it's fair is by making one myself. Turns out I just have really bad luck in general. Note that I 
did not implement split because I found that kind of complicated.

Run game with the following command:
> python game.py --tokens <N_TOKENS> --ndecks <N_DECKS> --minbet <MIN_BET> --maxbet <MAX_BET>
where
- N_TOKENS: number of tokens you want to start with, default is 2000
- N_DECKS: number of decks to use, default is 8
- MIN_BET: minimum bet allowed, default 1
- MAX_BET: maximum bet allowed, default 500
